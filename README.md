## Overview

This project analyzes audio features of music tracks using data retrieved from Spotify's API. Focusing on trends in song duration and emotional tone (valence) over time, the analysis explores patterns in albums released between 2018 and 2022, with a case study on the artist Joji. By using R and packages, the project combines statistical methods and visualization to uncover insights into evolving musical styles. Key findings include shifts in song duration variability and emotional tone, reflecting changes in musical themes and artist progression.
